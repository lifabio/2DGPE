# 2DGPE
Gross-Pitajevski equations sover in 2D through the Crank-Nicholson method with predictor-corrector. Realized in Fortran 95.
It solves the system of two-coupled Gross-Pitejevskii equations in 2 dimension.

This folder contains different version of the solver featuring the computations of different observables and the possibility to handle different initial conditions.
